                        course schedules for future school semesters. The following
                        documentation page will help Admins to navigate and maximize
                        the toolâ€™s capabilities. Admins will be able to gather student,
                        course, and teacher preference data. The collected data will
                        be used to create a course schedule to mitigate preference and
                        time constraints as well as conflicts. To get started, please
                        review the following overview of the sections to determine
                        where to start. Directions to navigate to required sections
                        will start from the home page. The following sections
                        will be displayed on the home screen for the Admin. To view the full documentation,
                        click <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="/static/cs3_documentation.pdf">here</a>.
